# E-COMMERCE-WEB-USING-HTML
"I have developed a static e-commerce website using HTML. The website is named 'E-commerce using HTML' and serves as a practical demonstration of my HTML skills. It showcases various products along with their prices and includes Amazon web links where users can purchase the products. You can access my website at https://e-commerce-using-html.netlify.app/."
